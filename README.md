# unurkey
Make your programmable keyboard with different layout become QWERTY on any PC

This Python script will write an AutoHotKey file and you can used its compiled file virtually on any PC.

"F#ck it." *unkeyboard your keyboard*

# How to
1. Run `unurkey.py` with console

2. Type `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` and `,./;'[]\` like how you would do on your keyboard but on QWERTY (so you need a QWERTY outputing keyboard and it will be unintelligible afterward)

3. Compile `unurkey.ahk` with AutoHotKey

4. Upload or store binary file somewhere with you when you need to use your cool keyboard on any machine
